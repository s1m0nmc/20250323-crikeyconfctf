I went down the correct path on NOTHING_TO_WORRY_ABOUT but wasted a bunch of time after a making a syntax error in a JWT `:cursing_face:` . If I'd not made that error I would have solved in 1/3 the time it ended up taking, but wouldn't have met [@fieldse](https://github.com/fieldse) and worked with him to solve NOTHING_TO_WORRY_ABOUT and SECURESYS. Oh, the name of the forensics challenge was misleading.
