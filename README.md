# CrikeyCon X
Went to [CrikeyCon X](https://crikeycon.com/). Learnt stuff. Had fun. Have the t-shirt and won a very cool prize while participating in the CTF.
## CTF
While it was difficult to balance listening to talks when there were CTF challenges to crack I did manage to complete a few.

I went down the correct path on NOTHING_TO_WORRY_ABOUT but wasted a bunch of time after a making a syntax error in a JWT. If I'd not made that error I would have solved in 1/3 the time it ended up taking, but wouldn't have met [@fieldse](https://github.com/fieldse) and worked with him to solve NOTHING_TO_WORRY_ABOUT and SECURESYS. Oh, the name of the forensics challenge was misleading.
